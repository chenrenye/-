Effect Due to Slip Distribution
Here, we study the effect of the slip distribution keeping
the hypocenter constant. We generate 20 random slip distri-
butions, each corresponding to an
M
7 earthquake. Again
the other kinematic parameters are obtained by the use of
the quasi-dynamic approach by Guatteri
et al.
(2004).
The results are shown in Figure 5 in the same way as in
Figure 4. As in the previous case, the mapped quantities ex-
hibit complex behavior. The largest rotation rate of the entire
study area for the vertical component is 4.5 times larger than
those of the
x
component and 6 times larger than those of the
y
component. For the
x
and
z
components (Fig. 5, top and
bottom left-hand panels), the largest rotation rates are located
above the fault, further from the epicenter close to the far
right-hand end of the fault trace (region E). For the
y
com-
ponent, the largest rotation rates happen at distinct points
above the fault but also further from the fault trace (point
P6 in Fig. 5, middle left-hand panel). For the
x
and
z
com-
ponents, the rotation rates around point P6 are much smaller
than those on the fault trace.



The spatial distributions of
R
SD
for all 20 simulations are
shown in Figure 5, middle column. The largest
R
SD
s of the entire study area are similar for all components (42% for the
x
component, 50% for the
y
component, and 45% for the
vertical component) but not located at the same places. For
the
x
component,
R
SD
is very large inside region F, which
is around the epicenter. For the other two components, the
high ratios are restricted inside region G (banded region
perpendicular to the fault trace). At point P7 (small basin
edge), higher ratios are found for the
y
and
z
components
but not for the
x
component when compared to those areas
around the fault trace (region F). Right above the fault, vary-
ing slip distributions introduce more variations on the fault-
parallel component of the rotation rate than on the other two
components.



The spatial distributions of the
R
max
ratio are shown in
Figure 5, right-hand column. These distributions are quite
similar to those for
R
SD
: the largest values of the entire study
area are observed in the same areas. Right above the fault,
large
R
max
values are observed for the
x
component but not
for the other two components, for which large values of
R are mostly restricted to region G (banded region perpendicu-
lar to the fault trace) further from the fault. High
R
max
values
are observed at point P7 (basin edge) for the
z
component.


Let us compare results obtained for a varied hypocen-
ter position (Fig. 4). The distribution of maximum values
(Figs. 4 and 5, left-hand columns) are very similar because
the maxima are located within the basin and close to the
fault. Comparing the results shown in Figures 4 and 5 in
terms of
R
SD
and
R
max
(middle and right-hand columns),
we can observe that varying the hypocenter has a stronger
effect than keeping the hypocenter fixed and varying the slip
histories. The case of varying slip distribution is character-
ized by larger variations within the basin in contrast to the
case of varying hypocenter positions, for which the largest
variations are located at the borders (
y
and
z
components)
or outside (
x
component) of the basin.

Comparison with Translations
For a horizontally polarized plane wave, the horizontal
(transverse) acceleration and the vertical rotation rate have
identical waveforms; they are scaled by twice the phase ve-
locity, see equation (2) (e.g., Igel
et al.
, 2005, 2007). Com-
parison of synthetic vertical rotation rates and horizontal
accelerations simulated for the
M
7 hypothetical earthquakes
on the
NI
fault showed that wavefronts are (near) planar
(Wang, 2007) and that it is appropriate to relate peak ampli-
tudes of translations and rotations. Because this amplitude
ratio is related to the local phase velocity (equation 2), the
ratios should be smaller inside the basin than outside because
the basin is characterized by lower velocities. Note that we
do not expect perfect match with the medium velocities be-
cause (1) the plane-wave assumption is not perfectly satisfied
and (2) the medium has depth-dependent velocities so only
some mean velocity can be obtained. We denote mean value
of the peak ground accelerations as
M
PGA
x
and
M
PGA
y
for
the
x
and
y
components, respectively. The mean value of
the peak vertical rotation rate is denoted as
M
PGRR

.

in map view (omitting the factor 2), together
with the basin depth (isosurface of the
2
km
=
sec shear-wave
velocity), for the cases of varying hypocenter (left-hand col-
umn) and varying slip history (right-hand column). For the
x
component of acceleration (Fig. 6, top row) the ratios are
small inside the basin. Outside of the basin, except for region
I, the estimated ratio is higher. In region I the ratio is still low,
which is not in agreement with the larger velocities therein.
This is not surprising because the waveforms themselves are
not expected to be similar for the
x
component (propagation
direction). In regions close to the northwest tip of the fault
trace, when varying either hypocenter location or slip his-
tory (Fig. 6, top row), the ratio is distinctly larger than
4000
m
=
sec, being much larger than those in the neighbor-
ing areas and not compatible with the velocity model. In such
areas, however, the assumption of an incoming plane wave is
roughly violated.


For the
y
component of acceleration (Fig. 6, middle
row), in region J (being outside the basin and thus character-
ized by large velocities) the ratio between the acceleration
and the vertical rotation rate is less than
1700
m
=
sec for
the varying hypocenter case (Fig. 6, middle left-hand panel).
This is, however, too low a value for the area outside of the
basin. We explain this due to poor similarity of the
y
compo-
nent of acceleration and the vertical rotation rate waveforms
in this area (Wang, 2007). In the strike directions where the
correlations are better, the predicted ratios are larger, corre-
sponding to larger velocities outside the basin. For the vary-
ing slip history case (Fig. 6, middle right-hand panel), the
ratios in region J are higher (corresponding to higher veloci-
ties in that area), which is, however, perhaps only accidental,
because in region K (above the fault) the ratios are again
higher than what would correspond to the local velocities.
On the other hand, off the fault in the strike direction, the
ratios again correspond roughly to the velocity model.

, is shown in Fig-
ure 6 (bottom row) for both varying the hypocenter (bottom
left-hand panel) and varying the slip history (bottom right-
hand panel). A strong relation between this average and the
local velocity is observed over almost the entire study area in
these two cases. Large values of this parameter nicely deline-
ate the basin structure. The only exceptions are the small re-
gions around the tips of the fault trace where the plane-wave
assumption is clearly violated.

Decay with Distance
It is of practical importance to study how the peak rota-
tion rates decay with distance. In particular, one can ask to
what extent is the decay comparable to the decay known
for peak translation motion (peak ground acceleration, peak
ground velocity, etc.), which is usually characterized by the
attenuation relations.
In Figure 7 we show the maximum amplitude of both the
y
component of acceleration and the vertical rotation rate
synthesized for the case of varying the hypocenter location
and plot them against the distance to the fault. At first glance,
the shapes of the point clouds are very similar. Both the ac-
celeration and the rotation rate saturate for fault distances
less than 10 km. It is also seen that the mean rotation rate
decreases with fault distance similarly to acceleration for
fault distances larger than 10 km. Local increase of the larg-
est values is observed for both the rotation rates and the ac-
celerations within range L (between 25 and 53 km). It covers
the small basin depicted as region B and the steepest basin
edge in region C in Figure 4, suggesting that the rotation
rates are amplified in a way similar to acceleration by the
small basin and the basin edge.

In conclusion, rotation rate linearly decreases with fault
distance in log
–
log coordinates just as acceleration does.
This suggests that when developing attenuation relationships
for rotational motions, similar expressions (as a function of
distance) as for the peak acceleration can be adopted.


Discussion and Conclusions
We investigated how rupture-model variability and
3D
structure affect ground rotation rates in the frequency range
up to 0.5 Hz. In the region surrounding the fault trace, the
vertical component of rotation rates is systematically several
times larger than the other two horizontal components, show-
ing that the source mechanism (pure strike slip) dominates
the ground rotation rates in this region.
Variation in the hypocenter location leads to large vari-
ations of the ground rotation rates. The fault-perpendicular
component of acceleration and the vertical rotation rates
are strongly affected by both the medium (basin structure)
and the slip asperity location. However, there are no obvious
effects of either the medium or the slip asperity location on
the fault-parallel component. That component is dominated
by the directivity effect. The basin effect is also observed for
the variations of the
y
and
z
components of the peak rotation
rates, the largest variations being located at the basin edges.
In the region close to the fault, where large rotation rates are
observed, the variations are small. Hence, not only the hy-
pocenter location but also the elastic properties of the me-
dium control the rotation rate variations.

For the case of varying slip history, the directivity effect
(if present) dominates the fault-parallel component in terms
of absolute values and relative variations. These variations
are, however, smaller than those for the case of varying
hypocenter location. The velocity medium effect is mainly
pronounced on the fault-perpendicular component when
considering the maximum value. The variations of the rota-tion rates are largest in the basin structure, especially for the
y
and
z
components.
Vertical rotation rates can be compared to horizontal ac-
celerations as was done on the global scale by Igel
et  al.
(2005, 2007). These authors theoretically derived, assuming
plane-wave incidence, the relation between the horizontal ac-
celerations and vertical rotation rates. The waveforms are
very similar, scaled by twice the local phase velocity (see
equation 2). In our study, we have found areas where the
waveform of one component of the horizontal acceleration
was very similar to the vertical rotation rate waveform
(Wang, 2007). This is consistent with the shear-wave radia-
tion pattern of a double couple. The fault-parallel component
of acceleration is similar to the vertical rotation rate in areas
perpendicular to the fault strike, while the fault-normal com-
ponent of acceleration is highly correlated to the vertical
rotation rate in the strike direction of the fault. Therefore,
waveform similarity is observed over the entire study area
for at least one of the acceleration horizontal components.
When the average of these ratios is considered, a good agree-
ment is obtained over the whole area under study. We have
found good correlation with the velocity model except for a
very small region surrounding the fault trace. This suggests a
new tool for basin edge detection based on the coprocess-
ing of translational and rotational ground motion. This, of
course, would require development of portable rotation
meters and systematic surveys of an area under study.


Finally, vertical rotation rate is found to decay with dis-
tance in a way very similar to acceleration. Therefore, similar
expressions (as a function of distance) as peak acceleration
can be adopted for rotational motions attenuation relation-
ships. This result is supported by the recent findings of
Stupazzini
et al.
(2009).
