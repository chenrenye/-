Abstract
The recent availability of accurate observations of rotational ground mo-
tions has reopened interest in understanding near-fault characteristics of such motions
in the context of strong ground motion and earthquake engineering. In order to in-
vestigate source and structure-dependent variations of rotational motions, we simulate
several
M
7 earthquakes with varying source scenarios on the Newport
–
Inglewood
(
NI
) fault embedded in the
3D
Los Angeles basin using a finite-difference method
in the frequency range up to 0.5 Hz. We use a precalculated database with several
hundred numerical Green
’
s functions for a discretized model of the
NI
fault that al-
lows arbitrary finite-fault scenarios to be synthesized by superposition. We investigate
source and basin effects on the rotational part of ground motion (namely maximum
peak ground rotation rates and their variations) and compare them with the corre-
sponding values of translational motion. Our main conclusions are: (1) the pure strike-
slip source mechanism leads to larger rotation rates around the vertical axis than
around the horizontal ones; (2) variation of hypocenter introduces more scatter on
ground rotation rate than variations of slip history; (3) the coprocessing of translation
and rotation recordings might reveal information on local velocity structure as indi-
cated by plane-wave theory; and (4) the attenuation of accelerations (horizontal com-
ponents) and rotation rate (vertical component) with distance from the fault are very
similar, suggesting that similar expressions (as a function of distance) as for the peak
accelerations can be adopted for the peak rotation rates when determining their at-
tenuation relations.
Introduction
In conventional earthquake engineering, seismic loads
on structures are formulated only in terms of the three trans-
lational ground-motion components. Nevertheless, each site
on the surface is subjected to six types of motions: three
translations along the
x
,
y
, and
z
axes as well as three rota-
tions about these axes (plus six components of strain in a
deformable body). The components of the vector of rotation

While the building response to translational motions has
been thoroughly investigated, the study of building response
to rotational motions is a relatively new field. The engineer-
ing importance of rotational components of seismic strong
ground motion was noted during the late sixties and early
seventies of the last century (e.g., Newmark and Hall, 1969;
Newmark and Rosenblueth, 1971). There are many reports
about rotations of tombstones and stone lanterns during large
earthquakes (e.g., Yamaguchi and Odaka, 1974). Zembaty
(2006) also pointed out that rotation effects become espe-
cially important in the case of high-rise buildings. Different
studies have shown that rotational excitations around hori-
zontal axes can be significant (e.g., Gupta and Trifunac,
1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, 1991). For example, rotational ex-
citations around horizontal axes are important for tall struc-
tures supported by soft soil. Excitations around the vertical
axis can dominate the response of long and stiff structures
supported by soft soils (Zembaty and Boffi, 1994). Such
buildings are very sensitive to angular momentum carried by
rotational waves. Despite these obvious effects of rotational
motions, they are not considered in earthquake engineering.
Theoretical studies (e.g., Boratynski and Teisseyre,
2004; Teisseyre, 2004) and observational results (e.g.,
Nigbor, 1994; Spudich
et al.
, 1995; McLeod
et al.
, 1998;
Spillman
et  al.
, 1998; Takeo, 1998) considered rotational
motions excited by a distant seismic source. A first contribu-
tion was a simulation study of rotational effects by Bouchon
and Aki (1982), who simulated rotational ground motions
near earthquake faults buried in layered media for strike-
slip and dip-slip fault models and obtained a maximum rota-

to measure.
Deployment of strong-motion accelerographs in many
seismic areas of the world during the past decades has pro-
duced data on translational components of motion during
many strong earthquakes. These data describe strong motion
in three orthogonal directions (two horizontal and one ver-
tical), but because the spacing of the recording sites is much
larger than the wavelengths of the recorded motions, little is
known today about the accompanying differential and rota-
tional motions in most areas of the world except some rare
studies (e.g., Spudich
et  al.
, 1995; Huang, 2003; Spudich
and Fletcher, 2008).
In recent decades ring laser technology succeeded in
detecting weak rotational motions radiated by earthquakes
(McLeod
et al.
, 1998; Pancha
et al.
, 2000; Igel
et al.
, 2005;
Cochard
et al.
, 2006; Igel
et al.
, 2007). At teleseismic dis-
tances the seismic-wave field can be well approximated by
plane waves. For example, let us assume a transverse plane
wave described by displacement

Igel
et al.
(2005) studied the similarity between the colocated
translations and rotations recorded by the ring laser. Their
observations (over the frequency range 1
–
150 sec) showed
that the waveforms have the expected similarity, and that
the amplitude ratios allow an accurate estimate of horizon-
tal phase velocities (Igel
et al.
, 2005; Cochard
et al.
, 2006;
Igel
et al.
, 2007). However, in the near-source region, the
fundamental assumption of the aforementioned study
—
plane-wave propagation
—
might be violated.
Translational and rotational components of strong mo-
tion radiated from an earthquake source are modified along
the propagation path through interference, focusing, scatter-
ing, and diffraction phenomena. In this article, we investigate
how ground rotation rates vary for a given slip history and
varying hypocenter location, as well as for fixed hypocen-
ter location and varying slip history. We perform numerical
modeling considering realistic a quasi-dynamic source and
3D
velocity models for the frequency range up to 0.5 Hz
and compare with the corresponding effects on translations.
Numerical Green
’
s Functions
In the following, we describe the basic concept of
the numerical Green
’
s functions (
NGFs
) approach, which
is based on the discretization of the representation theorem
(e.g., Aki and Richards, 2002; Spudich and Xu, 2003; Wang
et al.
, 2008). A target fault plane is divided into equal-sized
rectangular subfaults and for each of these subfaults, the cor-
responding ground response, denoted as
NGF
, is calculated
using a double-couple source mechanism (pure strike slip)
with an impulselike slip velocity function. Then, a finite-
source scenario can be synthesized by superposition of these
NGFs
convolved with appropriate slip functions. The method
is equivalent to that used, for example, in the COMPSYN
code (Spudich and Xu, 2003), which, however, assumes only
a
1D
medium. More detailed information about our method
can be found in Wang (2007) and Wang
et al.
(2008, equa-
tions 1 to 4). The forward calculations can be carried out
using any numerical solution to the
3D
wave propagation
problem. Here, we employ a high-order (fourth order in
space, second order in time) staggered-grid finite-difference
approach (e.g., Igel
et al.
, 1995; Graves, 1996; Ewald
et al.
,
2006) with efficient absorbing boundaries using perfectly
matched layers (e.g., Collino and Tsogka, 2001; Marcinko-
vich and Olsen, 2003) and averaging of elastic moduli and
densities to avoid diffraction effects (Moczo
et al.
, 2002).
The components of the vector of rotation are extracted by
calculating half the curl of the wave field at the surface
(equation 1).
We apply the
NGF
method to the Newport
–
Inglewood
(

) fault system located in the Los Angeles (
LA
) basin
(Fig. 1). A domain of

:
5
km, in the two hori-
zontal and vertical directions, is selected as the study area,
being rotated in order to have the
x
axis parallel to the
NI
fault. The velocity model is based on the elastic part of
the Southern California Earthquake Center (
SCEC
)
3D
veloc-
ity model for the
LA
basin (version 3, Kohler
et al.
, 2003),
not considering the inelastic attenuation. The depth of a
shear-wave velocity isosurface,

0
km
=
sec, is shown in Fig-
ure 2. To reduce the computational effort and the size of the
database, we truncate the seismic velocities at
1
:
4
km
=
sec,
which gives a maximum frequency resolution of 0.56 Hz
with our grid spacing of 0.3 km (Wang
et al.
, 2008). Note
that such a maximum frequency makes our study relevant,
from the engineering point of view, to rather large-scale
structures (bridges, etc.). For other structures higher frequen-
cies would be necessary, but we are limited by the computa-
tional demand. Moreover, for frequencies larger than, say,
1 Hz the medium model is not detailed enough and some
stochastic modeling approach would have to be adopted.
The
NI
fault is chosen for several reasons: it hosted
the
M
6.4 Long Beach earthquake in 1933 (Hauksson and
Gross, 1991), causing serious damage in
LA
, and it is still
considered the most probable source for a damaging
M
7
earthquake in the
LA
area (Toppozada
et  al.
, 1989). The
near-vertical plane can be approximated by a vertical plane
in the numerical calculation, and the predominant right-
lateral slip can be approximated with a pure strike-slip mech-
anism (Grant and Shearer, 2004). The seismic radiation,
which is expected to be sensitive to geometric complexity, is
in this case of relatively mature fault well approximated with
